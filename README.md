# Email-Spam-Classification
Email Spam Classification using NLP

This single script covers all the required tasks:
1.  Loads and preprocesses the Spam Email Dataset.
2.  Vectorizes the text data using TF-IDF.
3.  Builds, trains, and evaluates two models:
    a. A classic Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.
    b. A simple Sequential Neural Network with Keras.
4.  Evaluates the models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and a Confusion Matrix.
5.  Visualizes the confusion matrix using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
6.  Saves the trained neural network model as an .h5 file.
